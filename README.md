DESCRIPTION :

Had better understanding on the concepts of Principal component analysis and LDA.
Had good practical experience on calculating silhoeutte score, SVM performance, choosing clustering methods & scaling.

In the ICP,
I have learnt that PCA consists of two methods:
i)data compression and
ii) data visualization.

The difference between PCA & LDA is that, PCA & LDA both are dimenstionality reduction techniques. LDA tries to find feature subspace which maximizes class separability & PCA doesn't have such constraints. So, for LDA we used y variable also while fitting the data.

ASSIGNMENT- #4

DESCRIPTION :

Had better understanding on the concepts of Linear Regression and K-means clustering like cluster selection using elbow method.

Had good practical experience on calculating silhoeutte score, choosing clustering methods & scaling.

In the ICP,

1. Applied linear regression to the salary dataset provided and splitted train and test data having test data as 33%.
Calculated MSE & plotted graph to visualize train data and test data.

2. Applied K-means clustering using elbow method to find good number of clusters and calculated silhouette score which (I got) is 0.4657118789980141

3. Performed feature scaling and applied kmeans algorithm on the scaled features and calculated silhouette score which (I got) is 0.1976074492720698

Here, after performing scaling the silhouette score got dropped. 

The reason behind this poor silhouette score would be because of data skewness, which doesn't follow normal distribution.
and the other reason would be due to scaling, which made it even more difficult to seperate clusters.
