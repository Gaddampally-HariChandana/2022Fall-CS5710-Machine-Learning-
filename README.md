ASSIGNMENT- #6

VIDEO URL : https://ucmo0-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/hxg68820_ucmo_edu/Ec4icl7cMWFIqp4dA1OLHP8Bim0zOVZPZEFjmAjKx6ZxOA?e=X5HaW4 


DESCRIPTION :

Had better understanding on the concepts of Hierarchial clustering.

Had good practical experience on applying agglomerative clustering and calculating silhouette scores and visualizing by plotting the graphs.

In this ICP,

1.	Using Pandas imported the required CC General dataset. 

2.	Using head() to view the type of data & columns.

3.	Using dataframe.describe() for data description of the dataset.

4.	Preprocessing the data by removing the categorical column and filling the missing values.

5.	Applying StandardScaler() and normalize() functions to scale and normalize raw input data.

6.	Using PCA with K=2 to reduce the input dimensionality to two.

7.	Applying Agglomerative Clustering with k=2,3,4 & 5 on reduced features and visualize result for each k value using scatter plot.

8.	Evaluate different variations using Silhouette Scores and Visualize results with a bar chart.

9. Using the given 6 points of attributes from the tables provided in ICP and calculating the clustering of Single link, complete link and average link dendograms.

ASSIGNMENT- #5

DESCRIPTION :

Had better understanding on the concepts of Principal component analysis and LDA.
Had good practical experience on calculating silhoeutte score, SVM performance, choosing clustering methods & scaling.

In the ICP,
I have learnt that PCA consists of two methods:
i)data compression and
ii) data visualization.

The difference between PCA & LDA is that, PCA & LDA both are dimenstionality reduction techniques. LDA tries to find feature subspace which maximizes class separability & PCA doesn't have such constraints. So, for LDA we used y variable also while fitting the data.

ASSIGNMENT- #4

VIDEO URL : https://ucmo0-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/hxg68820_ucmo_edu/EVYSiebMIr1Cq-yzG3UWXCwBtC4LId4Ia5hrNb3Og25S7A?e=avYkO0

DESCRIPTION :

Had better understanding on the concepts of Linear Regression and K-means clustering like cluster selection using elbow method.

Had good practical experience on calculating silhoeutte score, choosing clustering methods & scaling.

In the ICP,

1. Applied linear regression to the salary dataset provided and splitted train and test data having test data as 33%.
Calculated MSE & plotted graph to visualize train data and test data.

2. Applied K-means clustering using elbow method to find good number of clusters and calculated silhouette score which (I got) is 0.4657118789980141

3. Performed feature scaling and applied kmeans algorithm on the scaled features and calculated silhouette score which (I got) is 0.1976074492720698

Here, after performing scaling the silhouette score got dropped. 

The reason behind this poor silhouette score would be because of data skewness, which doesn't follow normal distribution.
and the other reason would be due to scaling, which made it even more difficult to seperate clusters.
